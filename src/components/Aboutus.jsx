             Right from the start we bundle your
              ideas and our suggestions. We will assist you in determining the
              qualities and quantities of OS&E equipment in the areas of rooms,
              kitchen equipment, restaurant, stewarding, storage, public areas
              and housekeeping. We create budget lists for you that are kept up
              to date at all times. We would be happy to show you selected
              articles in a presentation. Once the order has been placed, we
              will work with you to plan the desired delivery dates for the
              individual areas. You don't have to manage a large number of
              individual invoices, but rather you receive an overall statement
              with a final invoice. â€¦we are here for you !
