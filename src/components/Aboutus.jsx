              Right from the start we bundle your ideas and our suggestions. We
              will assist you in determining the qualities and quantities of
              OS&E equipment in the areas of rooms, kitchen equipment,
              restaurant, stewarding, storage, public areas and housekeeping. We
              create budget lists for you that are kept up to date at all times.
              We would be happy to show you selected articles in a presentation.
              Once the order has been placed, we will work with you to plan the
              desired delivery dates for the individual areas. You don't have to
              manage a large number of individual invoices, but rather you
              receive an overall statement with a final invoice. â€¦we are here
              for you !
